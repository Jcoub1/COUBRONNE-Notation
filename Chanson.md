# Oh devil !

```Oh, Devil, I know you're afraid
Sometimes it's hard to learn from all your mistakes
Oh, Devil, I'm glad that you came
Guess I should learn how to live because you won't go away
Someone's calling for me
Something's calling for me, again
Oh, Devil, I'm back for a while
'Til I pick up the phone, look for your number and dial
Oh, Devil, I'm in my own hell
And deep inside I'm sure I got here all by myself
Someone's calling for me
Something's calling for me, again
Oh, I know
Oh, I know
Same old thing
Same old show
Oh, I know
Oh, I know
Same old thing
So show control
Oh, I know
Oh, I know
Same old thing
Same old show
Oh, I know
Oh, I know
Same old thing
So show control
